Scripts that help with Ubuntu install on Mac.

--------------------------
mac_res.sh
--------------------------
Set the resolution whenever it's called.
By default, Ubuntu uses the max resolution (2880x1800) which is really hard to read.

--------------------------
touchpad.sh
--------------------------
_Supposed_ to make the touchpad less sensitive so the pointer won't randomly click places when typing.
